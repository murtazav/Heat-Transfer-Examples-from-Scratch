**1. Body at constant temperature subjected to conduction from one end and convection from other and without heat generation**
The System chosen is a one dimensional copper initially at T = 293K subjected to conduction 
from one end at T = 320K and convection (forced convection:moderate air flow speed) from other at T = 298 K.
